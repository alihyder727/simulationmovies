These simulations show tracer dynamics from my most recent work (currently in review).  

The colorbars show mole fractions of carbon monoxide (CO). The overlaid gray and bluish regions are water cloud and rain, respectively.  The different
simulations show the dynamic effect of water enrichment on the behavior of CO, with higher enrichment leading to significantly reduced mixing efficiency at the
cloud levels.
